# hello-world
This is my start to using GitHub!
I used to code some in th 90's but have been out of the game for a while. Did code in C, C++, MySQL, HTML and PHP. 
Now I will start learning Python and also using GitHub to manage my learning and projects.
In this repo I will keep tabs on my steps towards becoming a true geek.
